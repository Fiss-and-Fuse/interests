# Open Source @ Illinois project interests repo
This is a spot for anyone to make a record of possible projects that they would 
like to work on. We've created several project areas with the types of projects in each area.

If you have an idea for a project, add a link to existing open source project or an open issue in that project.
If you want to start your own project, you can write a suggestion for that too.
